I am a researcher and academic in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning, currently serving as Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, College of IT, UAEU. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in Abu Dhabi, UAE. With over 15 years of teaching experience and a decade of research and development expertise, I strive to enhance the quality of life and community well-being through practical applications of technology. 

My research spans a broad range of topics including content-based multimedia analysis, precision agriculture, and medical image analysis. My work has been recognized globally, and I have collaborated with institutions in the USA, UK, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. I have also been involved in multiple funded research projects, and my innovations have led to four registered patents in South Korea. I am an IEEE Senior Member and I serve as a reviewer and editorial board member for several prestigious journals.
